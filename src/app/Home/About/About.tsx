            The Harvest Tabernacle Church (H.T.C.) is a Christian non-profit
            organization that started in January 2003. The purpose for the
            establishment of this denomination was a response to a call for a
            Church that would nurture believers to respond to a call by God to
            join Him in His mission â€“ to reconcile people with God and lead them
            to maturity.
